# QuickStack Development Plan

## 🎮 Game Concept

**QuickStack** is a fast-paced, skill-based 2D stacking game where players drop tetromino-style blocks to build the tallest and most stable tower possible. The game is designed for both single-player and competitive multiplayer modes.

### 🧠 Core Design Philosophy
- Encourage **quick decision-making** and **strategic tower management**
- Reward stability, clean play, and momentum through lock-based mechanics
- Track tower history visually and mechanically to reinforce progress
- Provide subtle but powerful ability-based interactions in multiplayer

### 🎯 Vision
- Competitive and casual appeal (easy to start, hard to master)
- Emphasis on **recoverable failure** — towers can wobble, collapse, or be re-stabilized
- Blend **Tetris familiarity** with **roguelike progression** (tower locking)
- Create a visual log of tower growth through the history system
- Enable long-term ranked play with server-based progression and match data

**QuickStack** is a competitive 2D multiplayer game where players drop tetromino-style blocks to build a tall and stable tower. The game includes a buffer zone for spawning, a visible play area, and a history zone below the fold to preserve previous tower sections.

- Players compete to build stable towers.
- Strategic locking of tower sections allows players to push progress downward and reset the board.
- Multiplayer interactions include visibility of other towers and real-time attacks.

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications

### Grid & Layout
- `GRID_SIZE = 20` pixels
- Board Dimensions:
  - `GUTTER_WIDTH = 4`
  - `TOWER_WIDTH = 10`
  - `BOARD_WIDTH = 18` (10 + 4 + 4)
  - `BUFFER_ROWS = 4`
  - `VISIBLE_ROWS = 30`
  - `HISTORY_ROWS = 30`
  - `BOARD_HEIGHT = 64`

### Tetromino System
- `TETROMINO_SHAPES` supports I, O, T, S, Z, J, L
- `JLSTZ_KICKS` used for wall kicks during rotation

---

## 🎯 Gameplay Mechanics

### Spawn & Preview Queue
- Next tetromino spawns in the buffer zone
- Preview queue shows upcoming pieces (default 3)
- `spawnTetromino(scene, shapes)` initializes a piece and starts the fall timer

### Drop & Collision
- `dropPiece(scene)` advances the piece downward
- `checkCollisionAt()` detects against board and history grid
- Drop speed increases with player level

### Piece Locking
- `lockPiece(scene)` saves block positions and renders them
- If blocks are placed below the fold, they update `historyGrid`
- Detects and scores completed lines (Tetris)

### Tower Section Locking
- Pressing **L** when `lockReady` is true triggers `lockTowerSection()`
- Everything from topRow down (except the top row) is moved to `historyGrid`
- That top row becomes the new foundation
- Level increases after each tower section lock

### Charge-based Lock System
- Lock ability must be charged by placing pieces
- Charge meter fills visually, showing progress
- Only when fully charged can the player lock a tower section

### Auto-Lock System
- Triggers countdown when tower reaches a threshold height
- Emergency instant lock when tower gets dangerously high
- Can be toggled on/off via UI

### History Grid
- Stores previous tower sections
- Renders below the fold using opacity
- Stack grows downward

### Level & Scoring System
- Level increases when tower section is locked
- Higher levels increase piece drop speed
- Scores awarded for:
  - Basic piece placement (scaled by level)
  - Completing lines (classic Tetris scoring, scaled by level)
  - Locking tower sections (large bonus, scaled by level)

---

## 🧠 UI/Sidebar
- Sidebar added on the right of the playfield (200px wide)
- Contains:
  - **Score**
  - **Level**
  - **Lines Cleared**
  - **Abilities** (with `updateAbilityText()`)
  - **Lock status** (with `updateSidebarText()`)
  - **Next Pieces Preview**
  - **Lock Charge Meter**
  - **Auto-Lock Toggle**
- Uses `wordWrap` and `fixedWidth` to prevent overflow

---

## ✅ Features Completed

- Complete tetromino system with rotation, wall kicks, and ghost pieces
- Tower section locking with history tracking
- Charge-based lock mechanic that requires strategic play
- Level progression system with increasing difficulty

- Auto-lock system with countdown and emergency locking
- Line completion detection with visual feedback (Tetris)
- Multiplayer-ready architecture using Colyseus with real-time updates

## 🔐 Technical Systems Planned

### Architecture Overview

#### 🎮 Client (Frontend)
- **Tech:** [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) (HTML5 Canvas Game Engine), ES Module-based JavaScript, Vite-powered build
- **Purpose:** Handles rendering, input, UI updates, physics, and animations
- **Assets:** Tetromino sprites and basic geometric shading
- **Modular Codebase:** All core gameplay logic (movement, collision, draw, etc.) split into small utility modules under `utils/`
- **Key UI Modules:** Sidebar with ability and lock status, score tracking, level display, charge meter

#### 🌐 Server (Backend)
- **Tech:** [Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/) multiplayer framework on Node.js
- **Purpose:** Manages multiplayer game rooms, synchronizes state, broadcasts messages, and handles player matchmaking
- **Rooms:** `NormalGameRoom.js` (default), extendable to ranked or chaotic rooms
- **Shared State:** Planned usage of Colyseus schemas (`shared/schema.js`) for synchronizing tower height, instability, and scores between players
- **Transport Layer:** WebSockets with room-based channels

### Instability System (Planned)
- Calculate tower stability based on:
  - Completed lines (more stable)
  - Overhanging pieces (less stable)
  - Height distribution (evenly distributed is more stable)
  - Tower height (taller is less stable)
- Visual indicators of instability
- Potential partial or complete collapse

### Multiplayer Framework (Colyseus)
- Matchmaking (future): general pool → ranked pool
- Game room sync: players receive updates via `adjacentTowerUpdate`
- Abilities can affect opponent state (e.g., `incomingAttack`)
- Shared state via schema (future-proofed in `/shared/schema.js`)

### History System
- Each tower section pushed into historyGrid on lock
- Truncated to last 30 rows max
- Drawn below the fold at `BUFFER_ROWS + VISIBLE_ROWS`
- Fade applied for visual separation (alpha = 0.5)
- Blocks can land on history and become part of it

## 🎨 Visual & UX Enhancements
- Sidebar layout with fixed-width wrapping
- Lock status display (`Ready (L)` vs `Charging...`)
- Score display dynamically updates
- Level and line count displays
- Charge meter with color coding
- Preview queue showing upcoming pieces
- Visual divider between tower and history zone
- Gutter shading for boundary clarity
- Animated block scaling on placement
- Pulsing highlights for completed lines

## 🔄 Game Lifecycle
- Room joins (`joinOrCreate`)
- Server sends `gameStart` → triggers `spawnTetromino`
- Player drops, rotates, locks pieces
- Triggers `blockPlaced` to server
- Server broadcasts back updated stats (like opponent height)
- Level increases after tower section locking
- Game speed increases with level progression
